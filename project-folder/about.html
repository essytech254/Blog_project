    "Misery in Love" began as a place for heartbreak — but evolved into a space of reflection, resilience, and recovery. 
    Here, I write not only to process what I’ve lost, but to honor what I’ve learned.

    If you're hurting, you're not alone. This is your sign that love begins again — this time with you.
